##### Bundesliga Predictor

This was basically my first first real ML prject where I did everything by myself and from scratch.
I found some Bundesliga-data online at https://fbref.com/en/comps/20/history/Bundesliga-Seasons and manipulated it a little so that the algorithm could work with it.
Then I pickled the model and loaded it into my flask API which would connect to my small html/css frontend. At the time where I did this project I unfortanetly didn't know about
streamlit which makes beautiful UIs but nonetheless I'm quite happy with the results.
