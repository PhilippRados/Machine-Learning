# Machine-Learning
Here you will find my humble beginnings as I start to learn about ML.

I built an Bundesliga Score Predictor and made a web App with it. I linked the model with the html via a flask API

### More recently I've started to try out Kaggle... that is where i'll probably do most of the Data Analysis and ML stuff: https://www.kaggle.com/docphilipp
